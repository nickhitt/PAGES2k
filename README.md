# PAGES2k
Machine Learning Techniques Applied to the PAGES2k Database

Some explorations include using the Pages2k temp reconstructions with NASA-GIS global temperature estimates which range from 1888-2003 to predict global temperatures over the last 2000 years using machine learning techiques. These include the following modelling techniques: linear models, randomForest, xgBoost Linear, and SVM linear. Missing data is assumed to be not random aand is solved with knnImputation.
