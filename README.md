Machine Learning Techniques Applied to the PAGES2k Database

Some explorations include using the Pages2k temp reconstructions with NASA-GIS global temperature estimates which range from 1888-2003 to predict global temperatures over the last 2000 years using machine learning techiques. These include the following modelling techniques: linear models, randomForest, xgBoost Linear, and SVM linear. 

UPDATE:
Check out the shiny app! This app shows how hindcasted global temperatures change based on:
- The continental temperature records chosen
- The type of ML algorithm used
- The training/test and cross validation folds used
- The calibration interval used
- Missing data imputation techique used
